Compared to a magic cat state stabiliser decomposition of all $53$ non-Clifford spiders ($6,377,292$ terms required), this is more than $7 \times 10^5$ times reduction in the number of terms. Our stabiliser decomposition has the advantage of representing the final non-Clifford state (in light of circuit errors) as a sum of Clifford ZX-diagrams. This will be useful in simulating the escape stage of magic state cultivation, where one need to port the resultant state of cultivation into a larger Clifford circuit with many more qubits. Still, it's necessary to only track $≈ 8$ Clifford terms. Our result sheds light on the simulability of operationally relevant, high $T$-count quantum circuits with some internal structure.</description><author>Kwok Ho Wan and Zhenghao Zhong</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08658</guid></item><item><title>Quantum architecture search with neural predictor based on ZX-calculus</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjqt/s40507-025-00410-w</link><description>With the ongoing advances in noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, variational quantum algorithms have demonstrated significant potential in a range of quantum applications. However, obtaining high-performance, shallow-parameterized quantum circuits typically requires repeated optimization of the gate parameters over a large set of candidate circuits, resulting in prohibitively high evaluation costs. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel predictor-based quantum architecture search (PQAS-ZX) method that leverages ZX-calculus. In this approach, a quantum circuit is first represented as a ZX diagram that supports multi-step equivalent simplifications at the diagram level. By applying these equivalence transformations, multiple circuit variants that share the same performance metric are generated, thereby significantly expanding the training dataset and enhancing the ability of the predictor to manage diverse circuit structures. ZX diagrams offer more flexible characterizations of multi-qubit entanglement and phase interactions, as well as higher-level equivalent transformations, compared with the state-of-the-art predictor-based quantum architecture search with graph measures (PQAS-GM). Numerical simulations of three variational quantum eigensolver tasks, namely the transverse-field Ising, Heisenberg, and BeH2 molecular models, demonstrated that PQAS-ZX required only approximately 80.9%, 82.9%, and 76.1% of the queries required by PQAS-GM, respectively, to achieve the same probability of reaching the target ground-state energy. These results highlight the advantage of using ZX diagrams to identify high-quality circuits efficiently and alleviate the evaluation burden of quantum architecture searches.</description><author>Shanchuan Li, Daisuke Tsukayama, Jun-ichi Shirakashi, Tetsuo Shibuya and Hiroshi Imai</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://epjquantumtechnology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjqt/s40507-025-00410-w</guid></item><item><title>Cutting stabiliser decompositions of magic state cultivation with ZX-calculus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01224</link><description>We apply the cutting stabiliser decomposition techniques [arXiv:2403.10964] to the quantum states generated from magic state cultivation [arXiv:2409.17595], post-selected upon all $+1$ measured values for simplicity.

Flow conditions ensure that the overall computation is deterministic in a suitable sense, and are required for efficient translation into quantum circuits. Procedures that rewrite MBQC patterns – e.g. for optimisation, or adapting to hardware constraints – thus need to preserve the existence of flow. Most previous work has focused on rewrites that reduce the number of qubits in the computation, or that introduce new Pauli-measured qubits. Here, we consider the insertion of planar-measured qubits into MBQC patterns, i.e. arbitrary measurements in a plane of the Bloch sphere spanned by a pair of Pauli operators; such measurements are necessary for universal MBQC. We extend the definition of causal flow, previously restricted to XY -measurements only, to also permit YZ-measurements and derive the conditions under which a YZ-insertion preserves causal flow. Then we derive conditions for YZ-insertion into patterns with gflow or Pauli flow, in which case the argument straightforwardly extends to XZ-insertions as well. We also show that the 'vertex splitting' or 'neighbour unfusion' rule previously used in the literature can be derived from YZ-insertion and pivoting. This work contributes to understanding the broad properties of flow-preserving rewriting in MBQC and in the ZX-calculus more broadly, and it will enable more efficient optimisation, obfuscation, or routing.</description><author>Miriam Backens and Thomas Perez</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14671</guid></item><item><title>String Diagrams for Defect-Based Surface Code Computing</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.426.6</link><description>Surface codes are a popular choice for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computing. Two-qubit gates may be realised in these codes using only nearest-neighbour interactions, either by lattice surgery or by braiding defects around each other. The effect of lattice surgery operations may be simply described using the ZX-calculus: a graphical language that has proven effective for program design and optimisation. In this work, we formalise a similar description via the ZX-calculus of defect braiding, as it is conventionally described. We define a graphical calculus KNOT, denoting the logical effects (in the absence of byproduct operations) of defect braiding in surface codes: we show how these effects may be described via a fragment of ZX-calculus which we call the (0, pi)-fragment. We then use a doubling construction to define a subtheory of KNOT, more specialised to standard encoding techniques in the defect braiding literature. Within this subtheory, we encompass standard braiding techniques by families of ribbon-like and tangle-like diagrams, each with semantics distinct from KNOT, in terms of the (0, pi)-fragment of ZX diagrams (again in the absence of byproducts). These subtheories may be used interoperably, and are each sound and complete for the (0, pi)-fragment of ZX diagrams. This provides a starting point to use the formal diagrammatics to analyse the operational effects of defect braiding procedures.</description><author>Mateusz Kupper, Dominic Horsman, Chris Heunen and Niel de Beaudrap</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14672</guid></item><item><title>Novel Methods for Classical Simulation of Quantum Circuits via ZX-Calculus</title><link>https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:54d6e7f4-b845-4275-98cd-cf6749530d9b/files/d9s1616869</link><description>With the limitations of today’s 'NISQ era' quantum hardware, classical simulation of quantum computations is an essential tool for understanding the quantum advantage and optimising quantum algorithms and systems. However, without the features unique to quantum computers, simulating such computations with classical hardware is (believed to be) a necessarily inefficient endeavour. For a general class of quantum circuits, any classical simulator requires a resource overhead which grows exponentially with one metric or another. Two notable and widely used techniques are tensor contraction and stabiliser decomposition. The former suffers from both space and time complexities that scale exponentially with the interconnectedness (or treewidth) of the circuit, while the latter is limited by a time complexity that scales exponentially with the number of 'non-Clifford' gates in the circuit. Recent years have seen the graphical language of ZX-calculus applied to this problem, with a particular growing body of research utilising its benefits to discover more efficient stabiliser decompositions. This in turn reduces the growth rate of the exponential time complexity, thereby rendering ever larger and more complex quantum circuits classically simulable. This thesis expands upon this literature by presenting various new techniques and approaches by which the ZX-calculus may be used to classically simulate quantum circuits with improved efficiencies. This work includes a new perspective on optimising stabiliser decomposition strategies, focusing on improved heuristics and decomposition patterns rather than on discovering wholly new decompositions. Also included is extensive use of GPU hardware to parallelise the workload, particularly used in conjunction with a parameterisation of the ZX-calculus which allows large sets of similar circuits to be reasoned upon as single entities. Lastly, this thesis features a hybrid method of classical simulation which leverages of the strengths of both tensor contraction and stabiliser decomposition approaches, optimising a balance between these techniques. Ultimately, the chapters ahead demonstrate how these new techniques can greatly increase the scope of classical simulation by reducing the runtime of this task by orders of magnitude and providing a foundation for further research.</description><author>Matthew Sutcliffe</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:54d6e7f4-b845-4275-98cd-cf6749530d9b/files/d9s1616869</guid></item><item><title>The decohered ZX-calculus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04296</link><description>The discard ZX-calculus is known to be complete and universal for mixed-state quantum mechanics, allowing for both quantum and classical processes. However, if the quantum aspects of ZX-calculus have been explored in depth, little work has been done on the classical side. In this paper, we investigate a fragment of discard ZX-calculus obtained by decohering the usual generators of ZX-calculus. We show that this calculus is universal and complete for affinely supported probability distributions over $픽_2^n$. To do so, we exhibit a normal form, mixing ideas from the graphical linear algebra program and diagrammatic Fourier transforms. Our results both clarify how to handle hybrid classical-quantum processes in the discard ZX-calculus and pave the way to the picturing of more general random variables and probabilistic processes.</description><author>Titouan Carette, Daniela Cojocaru and Renaud Vilmart</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04296</guid></item><item><title>Graphical Calculus for Fermionic Tensors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03976</link><description>We introduce a graphical calculus, consisting of a set of fermionic tensors with tensor-network equations, which can be used to perform various computations in fermionic many-body physics purely diagrammatically. The indices of our tensors primarily correspond to fermionic modes, but also include qubits and fixed odd-parity states. Our graphical calculus extends the ZX calculus for systems involving qubits. We apply the calculus in order to represent various objects, operations, and computations in physics, including fermionic Gaussian states, the partial trace of Majorana modes, purification protocols, fermionization and bosonization maps, and the construction of fermionic codes.</description><author>Yuanjie Ren, Kaifeng Bu and Andreas Bauer</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03976</guid></item><item><title>Optimization and Synthesis of Quantum Circuits with Global Gates</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20694</link><description>Compiling quantum circuits to account for hardware restrictions is an essential part of the quantum computing stack. Circuit compilation allows us to adapt algorithm descriptions into a sequence of operations supported by real quantum hardware, and has the potential to significantly improve their performance when optimization techniques are added to the process. One such optimization technique is reducing the number of quantum gates that are needed to execute a circuit. For instance, methods for reducing the number of non-Clifford gates or CNOT gates from a circuit is an extensive research area that has gathered significant interest over the years. For certain hardware platforms such as ion trap quantum computers, we can leverage some of their special properties to further reduce the cost of executing a quantum circuit in them. In this work we use global interactions, such as the Global Mølmer-Sørensen gate present in ion trap hardware, to optimize and synthesize quantum circuits. We design and implement an algorithm that is able to compile an arbitrary quantum circuit into another circuit that uses global gates as the entangling operation, while optimizing the number of global interactions needed. The algorithm is based on the ZX-calculus and uses an specialized circuit extraction routine that groups entangling gates into Global Mølmer-Sørensen gates. We benchmark the algorithm in a variety of circuits, and show how it improves their performance under state-of-the-art hardware considerations in comparison to a naive algorithm and the Qiskit optimizer.</description><author>Alejandro Villoria, Henning Basold and Alfons Laarman</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20694</guid></item><item><title>Quantum Circuit Optimization Based on Dynamic Grouping and ZX-Calculus for Reducing 2-Qubit Gate Count</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14434</link><description>In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, two-qubit gates in quantum circuits are more susceptible to noise than single-qubit gates. Therefore, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is crucial for improving circuit efficiency and reliability. As quantum circuits scale up, the optimization search space becomes increasingly complex, leading to challenges such as low efficiency and suboptimal solutions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a quantum circuit optimization approach based on dynamic grouping and ZX-calculus. First, a random strategy-based dynamic grouping method partitions the circuit into multiple subcircuits. Second, a ZX-calculus guided k-step lookahead search performs equivalent subcircuit filtering to minimize two-qubit gate counts. Third, a delay-aware placement method optimizes the recombined circuit to reduce the overall gate count. Finally, simulated annealing iteratively updates the grouping strategy to achieve an optimized two-qubit gate count. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in reducing two-qubit gates. Compared to the original circuits, the approach achieves an average reduction of 18% in two-qubit gates. It outperforms classical methods with up to 25% reduction, especially on gf circuits, and shows a 4% average improvement over heuristic ZX-calculus-based methods, validating its efficiency.</description><author>Kai Chen, Wen Liu, GuoSheng Xu, Yangzhi Li, Maoduo Li and Shouli He</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14434</guid></item></channel></rss>
