Viewing entanglement as the free energy of a membrane in a circuit-defined random environment, there is a competition between membrane smoothing due to lattice pinning and roughening due to disorder in the circuit. In particular, we investigate the randomness-induced roughening transition of the entanglement membrane in a (3+1)-dimensional Clifford circuit model, by calculating the entanglement entropy for various bipartitions. We further construct a scaling theory for membranes tilted away from lattice planes, uncovering new scaling forms and a crossover to a previously unexplored critical "tilted regime".</description><author>Hyunsoo Ha, David A.

Circuit optimization techniques help mitigate these limitations, enhancing algorithm feasibility. In this work, we implement, optimize, and execute a variational quantum regression algorithm using a novel state preparation method. By leveraging ZX-calculus-based optimization techniques, such as Pauli pushing, phase folding, and Hadamard pushing, we achieve a more efficient circuit design. Our results demonstrate that these optimizations enable the successful execution of the quantum regression algorithm on current hardware. Furthermore, the techniques presented are broadly applicable to other quantum circuits requiring arbitrary real-valued state preparation, advancing the practical implementation of quantum algorithms.</description><author>Frans Perkkola, Ilmo Salmeperä, Arianne Meijer-van de Griend, C. -C.

Such codes are defined by a schedule of error-detecting measurements, which allows for flexibility in their construction. In this work, we ask how best to optimise the measurement schedule of dynamically condensed colour codes in various limits of noise bias. We take a particular focus on the setting where measurements introduce more noise than unitary and idling operations - a noise model relevant to some hardware proposals. For measurement-biased noise models, we improve code performance by strategically repeating measurements within the schedule. For unbiased or $Z$-biased noise models, we find repeating measurements offers little improvement - somewhat contrary to our expectations - and investigate why this is. To perform this analysis, we generalise a metric called the teraquop footprint to the teraquop volume. This is the product of the number of qubits and number of rounds of measurements required such that the probability of a spacelike or timelike logical error occurring is less than $10^-12$. In most cases, we find differences in performance are primarily due to the number of rounds of measurements required, rather than the number of qubits - emphasising the importance of using the teraquop volume in the analysis. Additionally, our results provide another example of the importance of making use of correlated errors when decoding, in that using belief matching rather than minimum-weight perfect matching can turn a worst-performing code under a given noise model into a best-performing code.</description><author>Peter-Jan H.

However, it is difficult to reconcile the many different approaches that have been proposed, such as those based on binary matrices, ternary trees, and stabilizer codes. This challenge is further exacerbated by the many ways to describe them -- transformation of Majorana operators, action on Fock states, encoder circuits, and stabilizers of local encodings -- making it challenging to know when the mappings are equivalent. In this work, we present a graphical framework for fermion-to-qubit mappings that streamlines and unifies various representations through the ZX-calculus.   To start, we present the correspondence between linear encodings of the Fock basis and phase-free ZX-diagrams. The commutation rules of scalable ZX-calculus allows us to convert the fermionic operators to Pauli operators under any linear encoding. Next, we give a translation from ternary tree mappings to scalable ZX-diagrams, which not only directly represents the encoder map as a CNOT circuit, but also retains the same structure as the tree. Consequently, we graphically prove that ternary tree transformations are equivalent to linear encodings, a recent result by Chiew et al. The scalable ZX representation moreover enables us to construct an algorithm to directly compute the binary matrix for any ternary tree mapping. Lastly, we present the graphical representation of local fermion-to-qubit encodings. Its encoder ZX-diagram has the same connectivity as the interaction graph of the fermionic Hamiltonian and also allows us to easily identify stabilizers of the encoding.</description><author>Haytham McDowall-Rose, Razin A.

However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.</description><author>Byungmin Kang, Chen Zhao, Zhengwei Liu, Xun Gao and Soonwon Choi</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06336</guid></item><item><title>Planar fault-tolerant circuits for non-Clifford gates on the 2D color code</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05175</link><description>We introduce a family of scalable planar fault-tolerant circuits that implement logical non-Clifford operations on a 2D color code, such as a logical $T$ gate or a logical non-Pauli measurement that prepares a magic $|Tångle$ state. The circuits are relatively simple, consisting only of physical $T$ gates, $CX$ gates, and few-qubit measurements. They can be implemented with an array of qubits on a 2D chip with nearest-neighbor couplings, and no wire crossings. The construction is based on a spacetime path integral representation of a non-Abelian 2+1D topological phase, which is related to the 3D color code. We turn the path integral into a circuit by expressing it as a spacetime $ZX$ tensor network, and then traversing it in some chosen time direction. We describe in detail how fault tolerance is achieved using a "just-in-time" decoding strategy, for which we repurpose and extend state-of-the-art color-code matching decoders.</description><author>Andreas Bauer and Julio C.

Our approach offers a systematic methodology for designing and analysing surgery protocols. At the physical level, we introduce the concept of subcodes, which encapsulate all the necessary data for performing surgery. At the logical level, leveraging homological algebra, subcodes enable us to track the logical operations induced by any surgery protocol, regardless of the choice of logical operator basis. In particular, we make no assumptions on the structure of the logical operators of the code, thereby eschewing the irreducibility assumption that has been necessary in other formulations of surgery for CSS codes [Coh+22; Cro+24; ZL24]. As a proof of concept, we develop a surgery protocol inspired by lattice surgery that implements a logical CNOT gate between any two logical qubits. Applicable to any CSS code, this protocol is highly versatile and facilitates the process of fault-tolerant design.</description><author>Clément Poirson, Joschka Roffe and Robert I.

Active volume architectures, with long-range connectivity, aim to remove idle spacetime volume leaving only the spacetime volume that logically contributes to a computation. In this work we optimise and derive the active volumes for several industry-leading low- and high-level arithmetic subroutines and achieve significant T-count reductions. We discuss a simple method for estimating and optimising active volumes using orientated ZX diagrams. We also demonstrate that circuit structure, beyond gate counts alone, impacts the active volume of a subroutine and therefore should be taken into consideration when designing circuits.</description><author>Sam Heavey</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19626</guid></item><item><title>Clifford and Non-Clifford Splitting in Quantum Circuits: Applications and ZX-Calculus Detection Procedure</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16004</link><description>Classical simulation of quantum circuits is a pivotal part of the quantum computing landscape, specially within the NISQ era, where the constraints imposed by available hardware are unavoidable. The Gottesman-Knill theorem further motivates this argument by accentuating the importance of Clifford circuits and their role on this topic of simulation. In this work, we propose and analyze use cases that come from quantum circuits that can be written as product between a Clifford and a Non-Clifford unitary, these ranging from fully classical emulation, hybrid quantum-classical execution or even quantum algorithm simplification. To further complement this analysis, we make use of ZX-Calculus and its assets to detect a limiting border of these circuits that would allow for a separation between a Clifford section and a Non-Clifford section. To achieve this, we present a novel procedure for parsing ZX diagrams, that not only allows for the detection of this border but also simplifies the circuit extraction process.</description><author>Fernando Lima and Arcesio Castañeda Medina</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16004</guid></item><item><title>Rapidly Trainable and Shallow-Compiled Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Maximum Likelihood Detection</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physleta.2025.130541</link><description>In multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem is NP-hard and becomes increasingly complex with more transmitting antennas and symbols. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), a leading candidate algorithm running in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, can show quantum advantage for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an improved QAOA based maximum likelihood detection. In the proposed scheme, we use ZX-calculus to prove the parameter symmetry in QAOA circuits, which can be used to reduce the search space and accelerate the training process. Moreover, to run QAOA on quantum devices, an improved qubit mapping method with simultaneous gate absorption is proposed, which can compile the quantum circuit of the QAOA to satisfy the connectivity constraints of real quantum devices with fewer CNOT counts. In numerical experiments, our scheme accelerates parameter training by an average of 29.8% and uses fewer CNOT gates and shallower circuit depth during compilation. This demonstrates that our scheme has significant advantages over the traditional scheme.</description><author>Yuxiang Liu, Yinuo Qian, Lu Wang, Zaichen Zhang and Xutao Yu</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960125003214</guid></item></channel></rss>
