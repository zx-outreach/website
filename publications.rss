The former extends Gaussian probabilistic processes by completely-uninformative priors, and the latter extends Gaussian quantum mechanics with infinitely-squeezed states. These presentations are given by adding a generator to the presentation of real affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations.   The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states with a representation for Gaussian transformations. We interpret the LOv-calculus, a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about passive linear-optical quantum circuits in our presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations. Moreover, we show how our presentation allows for additional optical operations such as active squeezing.</description><author>Robert I.

Recently, it was shown that, when combined with a family of "sum-over-Cliffords" techniques, the ZX-calculus provides a powerful tool for classical simulation of quantum circuits. However, for several important classical simulation tasks, such as computing the probabilities associated with many measurement outcomes of a single quantum circuit, this technique results in reductions over many very similar diagrams, where much of the same computational work is repeated. In this paper, we show that the majority of this work can be shared across branches, by developing reduction strategies that can be run parametrically on diagrams with boolean free parameters. As parameters only need to be fixed after the bulk of the simplification work is already done, we show that it is possible to perform the final stage of classical simulation quickly utilising a high degree of GPU parallelism. Using these methods, we demonstrate speedups upwards of 100x for certain classical simulation tasks vs. the non-parametric approach.</description><author>Matthew Sutcliffe and Aleks Kissinger</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06777</guid></item><item><title>A Complete Graphical Language for Linear Optical Circuits with Finite-Photon-Number Sources and Detectors</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17693</link><description>Linear optical circuits can be used to manipulate the quantum states of photons as they pass through components including beam splitters and phase shifters. Those photonic states possess a particularly high level of expressiveness, as they reside within the bosonic Fock space, an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. However, in the domain of linear optical quantum computation, these basic components may not be sufficient to efficiently perform all computations of interest, such as universal quantum computation. To address this limitation it is common to add auxiliary sources and detectors, which enable projections onto auxiliary photonic states and thus increase the versatility of the processes. In this paper, we introduce the $\textbfLO_fi$-calculus, a graphical language to reason on the infinite-dimensional bosonic Fock space with circuits composed of four core elements of linear optics: the phase shifter, the beam splitter, and auxiliary sources and detectors with bounded photon number. We present an equational theory that we prove to be complete: two $\textbfLO_fi$-circuits represent the same quantum process if and only if one can be transformed into the other with the rules of the $\textbfLO_fi$-calculus. We give a unique and compact universal form for such circuits.</description><author>Nicolas Heurtel</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17693</guid></item><item><title>All graph state verification protocols are composably secure</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01445</link><description>Graph state verification protocols allow multiple parties to share a graph state while checking that the state is honestly prepared, even in the presence of malicious parties. Since graph states are the starting point of numerous quantum protocols, it is crucial to ensure that graph state verification protocols can safely be composed with other protocols, this property being known as composable security. Previous works [YDK21] conjectured that such a property could not be proven within the abstract cryptography framework: we disprove this conjecture by showing that all graph state verification protocols can be turned into a composably secure protocol with respect to the natural functionality for graph state preparation. Moreover, we show that any unchanged graph state verification protocols can also be considered as composably secure for a slightly different, yet useful, functionality. Finally, we show that these two results are optimal, in the sense that any such generic result, considering arbitrary black-box protocols, must either modify the protocol or consider a different functionality.   Along the way, we show a protocol to generalize entanglement swapping to arbitrary graph states that might be of independent interest.</description><author>LÃ©o Colisson, Damian Markham and Raja Yehia</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01445</guid></item><item><title>Minimality in Finite-Dimensional ZW-Calculi</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16225</link><description>The ZW-calculus is a graphical language capable of representing 2-dimensional quantum systems (qubit) through its diagrams, and manipulating them through its equational theory. We extend the formalism to accommodate finite dimensional Hilbert spaces beyond qubit systems. First we define a qudit version of the language, where all systems have the same arbitrary finite dimension d, and show that the provided equational theory is both complete -- i.e. semantical equivalence is entirely captured by the equations -- and minimal -- i.e. none of the equations are consequences of the others. We then extend the graphical language further to accommodate all finite dimensional Hilbert spaces at the same time. We again show the completeness of the provided equational theory.</description><author>Marc de Visme and Renaud Vilmart</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16225</guid></item><item><title>Optimal compilation of parametrised quantum circuits</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12877</link><description>Parametrised quantum circuits contain phase gates whose phase is determined by a classical algorithm prior to running the circuit on a quantum device. Such circuits are used in variational algorithms like QAOA and VQE. In order for these algorithms to be as efficient as possible it is important that we use the fewest number of parameters. We show that, while the general problem of minimising the number of parameters is NP-hard, when we restrict to circuits that are Clifford apart from parametrised phase gates and where each parameter is used just once, we can efficiently find the optimal parameter count. We show that when parameter transformations are required to be sufficiently well-behaved that the only rewrites that reduce parameters correspond to simple 'fusions'. Using this we find that a previous circuit optimisation strategy by some of the authors [Kissinger, van de Wetering. PRA (2019)] finds the optimal number of parameters. Our proof uses the ZX-calculus. We also prove that the standard rewrite rules of the ZX-calculus suffice to prove any equality between parametrised Clifford circuits.</description><author>John van de Wetering, Richie Yeung, Tuomas Laakkonen and Aleks Kissinger</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12877</guid></item><item><title>Graphical Symplectic Algebra</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07914</link><description>We give complete presentations for the dagger-compact props of affine Lagrangian and coisotropic relations over an arbitrary field. This provides a unified family of graphical languages for both affinely constrained classical mechanical systems, as well as odd-prime-dimensional stabiliser quantum circuits. To this end, we present affine Lagrangian relations by a particular class of undirected coloured graphs. In order to reason about composite systems, we introduce a powerful scalable notation where the vertices of these graphs are themselves coloured by graphs. In the setting of stabiliser quantum mechanics, this scalable notation gives an extremely concise description of graph states, which can be composed via ``phased spider fusion.'' Likewise, in the classical mechanical setting of electrical circuits, we show that impedance matrices for reciprocal networks are presented in essentially the same way.</description><author>Robert I.

However, current applications are all based on support vector machines and gradient-free optimization methods. Differentiating an optical circuit over a phase parameter poses difficulty because it results in an operator on the Fock space which is not unitary. In this paper, we show that the derivative of the expectation values of a linear optical circuit can be computed by sampling from a larger circuit, using one additional photon. In order to express the derivative in terms of expectation values, we develop a circuit extraction procedure based on unitary dilation. We end by showing that the full gradient of a universal programmable interferometer can be estimated using polynomially many queries to a boson sampling device. This is in contrast to the qubit setting, where exponentially many parameters are needed to cover the space of unitaries. Our algorithm enables applications of photonic technologies to machine learning, quantum chemistry and optimization, powered by gradient descent.</description><author>Giovanni de Felice and Christopher Cortlett</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07997</guid></item><item><title>Nonunitary gates using measurements only</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17325</link><description>Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a universal platform to realize unitary gates, only using measurements which act on a pre-prepared entangled resource state. By deforming the measurement bases, as well as the geometry of the resource state, we show that MBQC circuits always transmit and act on the input state but generally realize nonunitary logical gates. In contrast to the stabilizer formalism which is often used for unitary gates, we find that ZX calculus is an ideal computation method of these nonunitary gates. As opposed to unitary gates, nonunitary gates can not be applied with certainty, due to the randomness of quantum measurements. We maximize the success probability of realizing nonunitary gates, and discuss applications including imaginary time evolution, which we demonstrate on a noisy intermediate scale quantum device.</description><author>Daniel Azses, Jonathan Ruhman and Eran Sela</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17325</guid></item><item><title>Graphical CSS Code Transformation Using ZX Calculus</title><link>https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/20193/Li_SarahMeng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y</link><description>In this work, we present a generic approach to transform CSS codes by building upon their equivalence to phase-free ZX diagrams. Using the ZX calculus, we demonstrate diagrammatic transformations between encoding maps associated with different codes. As a motivating example, we give explicit transformations between the Steane code and the quantum Reed-Muller code, since by switching between these two codes, one can obtain a fault-tolerant universal gate set. To this end, we propose a bidirectional rewrite rule to find a (not necessarily transversal) physical implementation for any logical ZX diagram in any CSS code. We then focus on two code transformation techniques: code morphing, a procedure that transforms a code while retaining its fault-tolerant gates, and gauge fixing, where complimentary codes can be obtained from a common subsystem code (e.g., the Steane and the quantum Reed-Muller codes from the J15, 1, 3, 3K code). We provide explicit graphical derivations for these techniques and show how ZX and graphical encoder maps relate several equivalent perspectives on these code-transforming operations</description><author>Sarah Meng Li</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/20193/Li_SarahMeng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y</guid></item></channel></rss>
