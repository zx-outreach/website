We introduce a representation of stabilizer codes as graphs with certain structures. Specifically, the graphs take a semi-bipartite form where input nodes map to output nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. Intuitively, the graph's input-output edges represent information propagation of the encoder, while output-output edges represent the code's entanglement. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a universal recipe for code construction by finding graphs with nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes. We construct several constant-size codes and several infinite code families. We also use graphs to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound to a three-way distance-rate-weight trade-off. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms, distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding, are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing encoding circuits whose depths scale with the degree and for implementing certain logical diagonal and Clifford gates with reduced depth. Finally, we find an efficient decoding algorithm for certain classes of graphs. These results give evidence that graphs are useful for the study of quantum computing and its implementations.</description><author>Andrey Boris Khesin</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17959</guid></item><item><title>Pauli web of the $|Yångle$ state surface code injection</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15566</link><description>We employ ZX-calculus and Pauli web to understand the $|Yångle$ state injection on the rotated surface code.</description><author>Kwok Ho Wan and Zhenghao Zhong</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15566</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic T-decomposition for classical simulation of quantum circuits</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17182</link><description>It is known that a quantum circuit may be simulated with classical hardware via stabilizer state (T-)decomposition in $O(2^α t)$ time, given $t$ non-Clifford gates and a decomposition efficiency $α$. The past years have seen a number of papers presenting new decompositions of lower $α$ to reduce this runtime and enable simulation of ever larger circuits. More recently, it has been demonstrated that well placed applications of apparently weaker (higher $α$) decompositions can in fact result in better overall efficiency when paired with the circuit simplification strategies of ZX-calculus.   In this work, we take the most generalized T-decomposition (namely vertex cutting), which achieves a poor efficiency of $α=1$, and identify common structures to which applying this can, after simplification via ZX-calculus rewriting, yield very strong effective efficiencies $α_\texteffłl1$. By taking into account this broader scope of the ZX-diagram and incorporating the simplification facilitated by the well-motivated cuts, we derive a handful of efficient T-decompositions whose applicabilities are relatively frequent. In benchmarking these new 'dynamic' decompositions against the existing alternatives, we observe a significant reduction in overall $α$ and hence overall runtime for classical simulation, particularly for certain common circuit classes.</description><author>Wira Azmoon Ahmad and Matthew Sutcliffe</author><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17182</guid></item><item><title>A Constant Measurement Quantum Algorithm for Graph Connectivity</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15015</link><description>We introduce a novel quantum algorithm for determining graph connectedness using a constant number of measurements. The algorithm can be extended to find connected components with a linear number of measurements. It relies on non-unitary abelian gates taken from ZX calculus. Due to the fusion rule, the two-qubit gates correspond to a large single action on the qubits. The algorithm is general and can handle any undirected graph, including those with repeated edges and self-loops. The depth of the algorithm is variable, depending on the graph, and we derive upper and lower bounds. The algorithm exhibits a state decay that can be remedied with ancilla qubits. We provide a numerical simulation of the algorithm.</description><author>Maximilian Balthasar Mansky, Chonfai Kam and Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15015</guid></item><item><title>Towards Faster Quantum Circuit Simulation Using Graph Decompositions, GNNs and Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=54060pbCKY</link><description>In this work, we train a graph neural network with reinforcement learning to more efficiently simulate quantum circuits using the ZX-calculus.

While its graphical rewrite rules preserve semantics, they may not preserve other features. For example, applying rewrites to a circuit that implements an error-correcting code can change its distance. Here, we define the notion of distance-preserving rewrites that enables the transformation of error-correcting codes without changing their distance. Using these rewrites, we propose an algorithm that transforms a high-weight Pauli measurement into an equivalent quantum circuit with only single- and two-qubit operations. Since we only use distance-preserving rewrites, we guarantee that errors in the low-weight implementation do not propagate to create multiple data errors. Going further, we generalise the Floquetification procedure of [arXiv:2308.15489] to arbitrary stabiliser codes. Given a stabiliser code, we synthesise a new quantum error-correcting code which encodes the same number of qubits with at least the same distance. The number of additional qubits this method requires is linearly dependent on the weight or the largest Pauli measurement. This creates a tradeoff between easily implementable low-weight Pauli measurements at the cost of additional physical qubits.</description><author>Benjamin Rodatz, Boldizsár Poór and Aleks Kissinger</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17240</guid></item><item><title>Dynamical weight reduction of Pauli measurements</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12527</link><description>Many routines that one might want to run on a quantum computer can benefit from adaptive circuits, relying on mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward operations. Any such measurement has to be compiled into a sequence of elementary gates involving only a small number of qubits. In this work, we formalize dynamical weight reduction (DWR) schemes in which a high-weight Pauli measurement is decomposed into a sequence of measurements of smaller weight at the cost of adding additional auxiliary qubits. We first present our main method, deforming a ZX diagram that represents the measurement we want to compile. We then construct a general recipe that constructs a DWR on a given connectivity whenever the underlying connectivity graph fulfills certain necessary conditions. Further, we construct a family of DWR schemes using a given number of auxiliary qubits with indications that the schemes we present are optimal in terms of spacetime resource overheads needed for a DWR. We highlight three examples that achieve a constant time or a constant space overhead, respectively. Finally, we discuss different trade-offs of space and time overhead and how they might be chosen differently on different levels of abstraction within a (fault-tolerant) quantum computation. This work showcases the flexibility in compiling a measurement circuit in terms of lower-weight measurements using deformations of ZX diagrams and can find applications in quantum error correction, quantum simulation as well as near-term quantum computing tasks where the quality of a computation highly depends on the physical implementation of a given logical operation.</description><author>Julio C.

Recently proposed fusion-based architectures aim to achieve universality and fault-tolerance. In these approaches, computation is carried out by performing fusion and single-qubit measurements on a resource graph state. The verification of these architectures requires linear algebraic, probabilistic, and control flow structures to be combined in a unified formal language. This paper develops a framework for photonic quantum computing by bringing together linear optics, ZX calculus, and dataflow programming. We characterize fusion measurements that induce Pauli errors and show that they are correctable using a novel flow structure for fusion networks. We prove the correctness of new repeat-until-success protocols for the realization of arbitrary fusions and provide a graph-theoretic proof of universality for linear optics with entangled photon sources. The proposed framework paves the way for the development of compilation algorithms for photonic quantum computing.</description><author>Giovanni de Felice, Boldizsár Poór, Lia Yeh and William Cashman</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13541</guid></item></channel></rss>
