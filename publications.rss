These calculi involve 'rewrite rules', which are algebraic manipulations of the tensor networks through transformations of diagrams. The way in which diagrams denote tensor networks is through a semantic map, which assigns a meaning to each diagram in a compositional way. Slightly different semantic maps, which may prove more convenient for one purpose or another (e.g., analysing unitary circuits versus analysing counting complexity), give rise to slightly different rewrite systems. Through a simple application of measure theory on discrete sets, we describe a semantic map for ZX and ZH diagrams for qudits of any dimension D&gt;1, well-suited to represent unitary circuits, and admitting simple rewrite rules. In doing so, we reproduce the 'well-tempered' semantics of [arXiv:2006.02557] for ZX and ZH diagrams in the case D=2. We demonstrate rewrite rules for the 'stabiliser fragment' of the ZX calculus and a 'multicharacter fragment' of the ZH calculus; and demonstrate relationships which would allow the two calculi to be used interoperably as a single 'ZXH calculus'.</description><author>Niel de Beaudrap and Richard D.

We use the ZH-calculus, a universal and complete graphical language for linear maps which naturally encodes counting problems in terms of diagrams, to give graphical reductions from #SAT to several related counting problems. Some of these graphical reductions, like to #2SAT, are substantially simpler than known reductions via the matrix permanent. Additionally, our approach allows us to consider the case of counting solutions modulo an integer on equal footing. Finally, since the ZH-calculus was originally introduced to reason about quantum computing, we show that the problem of evaluating ZH-diagrams in the fragment corresponding to the Clifford+T gateset, is in $FP^#P$. Our results show that graphical calculi represent an intuitive and useful framework for reasoning about counting problems.</description><author>Tuomas Laakkonen, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis and John van de Wetering</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02524</guid></item><item><title>A recursively partitioned approach to architecture-aware ZX Polynomial synthesis and optimization</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17366</link><description>The synthesis of quantum circuits from phase gadgets in the ZX-calculus facilitates quantum circuit optimization. Our work provides an alternative formulation for the architecture-aware synthesis algorithm of PauliOpt by replacing the stochastic approach of PauliOpt with a heuristic based search and utilizes a divide and conquer method to synthesize an optimized circuit from a ZX polynomial. We provide a comparison of our algorithm with PauliOpt and other state-of-the-art optimization libraries. While we note poorer performance for highly structured circuits, as in the QAOA formulation for Max-Cut, we demonstrate a significant advantage for randomized circuits, which highlights the advantages of utilizing an architecture-aware methodology.</description><author>David Winderl, Qunsheng Huang and Christian B.

The language is non-linear; duplicated variables denote, not cloning of quantum data, but sharing a qubit's state; that is, producing an entangled pair of qubits whose amplitudes are identical with respect to a chosen basis. The language has two abstraction operators, $ζ$ and $ξ$, corresponding to the Z- and X-bases; each abstraction operator is also parameterised by a phase, indicating a rotation that is applied to the input before it is shared. We give semantics for the language in the ZX-calculus and prove its equational theory sound. We show how this language can provide a good representation of higher-order functions in the quantum world.</description><author>Nicklas Botö and Fabian Forslund</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17399</guid></item><item><title>Unifying flavors of fault tolerance with the ZX calculus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08829</link><description>There are several models of quantum computation which exhibit shared fundamental fault-tolerance properties. This article makes commonalities explicit by presenting these different models in a unifying framework based on the ZX calculus. We focus on models of topological fault tolerance - specifically surface codes - including circuit-based, measurement-based and fusion-based quantum computation, as well as the recently introduced model of Floquet codes. We find that all of these models can be viewed as different flavors of the same underlying stabilizer fault-tolerance structure, and sustain this through a set of local equivalence transformations which allow mapping between flavors. We anticipate that this unifying perspective will pave the way to transferring progress among the different views of stabilizer fault-tolerance and help researchers familiar with one model easily understand others.</description><author>Hector Bombin, Daniel Litinski, Naomi Nickerson, Fernando Pastawski and Sam Roberts</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08829</guid></item><item><title>Modular decoding: parallelizable real-time decoding for quantum computers</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04846</link><description>Universal fault-tolerant quantum computation will require real-time decoding algorithms capable of quickly extracting logical outcomes from the stream of data generated by noisy quantum hardware. We propose modular decoding, an approach capable of addressing this challenge with minimal additional communication and without sacrificing decoding accuracy. We introduce the edge-vertex decomposition, a concrete instance of modular decoding for lattice-surgery style fault-tolerant blocks which is remarkably effective. This decomposition of the global decoding problem into sub-tasks mirrors the logical-block-network structure of a fault-tolerant quantum circuit. We identify the buffering condition as a key requirement controlling decoder quality; it demands a sufficiently large separation (buffer) between a correction committed by a decoding sub-task and the data unavailable to it. We prove that the fault distance of the protocol is preserved if the buffering condition is satisfied. Finally, we implement edge-vertex modular decoding and apply it on a variety of quantum circuits, including the Clifford component of the 15-to-1 magic-state distillation protocol. Monte Carlo simulations on a range of buffer sizes provide quantitative evidence that buffers are both necessary and sufficient to guarantee decoder accuracy. Our results show that modular decoding meets all the practical requirements necessary to support real-world fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description><author>Héctor Bombín, Chris Dawson, Ye-Hua Liu, Naomi Nickerson, Fernando Pastawski and Sam Roberts</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04846</guid></item><item><title>Simple Complete Equational Theories for Quantum Circuits with Ancillae or Partial Trace</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03117</link><description>Although quantum circuits have been ubiquitous for decades in quantum computing, the first complete equational theory for quantum circuits has only recently been introduced. Completeness guarantees that any true equation on quantum circuits can be derived from the equational theory. Our contribution is twofold: (i) We simplify this equational theory by proving that several rules can be derived from the remaining ones. In particular, two out of the three most intricate rules are removed, the third one being slightly simplified. (ii) We extend the complete equational theory to quantum circuits with ancillae or qubit discarding, to represent respectively quantum computations using an additional workspace, and hybrid quantum computations. We show that the remaining intricate rule can be greatly simplified in these more expressive settings. The development of simple and complete equational theories for expressive quantum circuit models opens new avenues for reasoning about quantum circuits. It provides strong formal foundations for various compiling tasks such as circuit optimisation, hardware constraint satisfaction and verification.</description><author>Alexandre Clément, Noé Delorme, Simon Perdrix and Renaud Vilmart</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03117</guid></item><item><title>Basic ZX-calculus for students and professionals</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03163</link><description>These are the lecture notes of guest lectures for Artur Ekert's course Introduction to Quantum Information at the Mathematical Institute of Oxford University, Hilary Term 2023.

We perform a pre-processing step classically, which reduces the dimensionality of the problem by generating a custom mapping which excludes states which violate problem constraints. Subsequently, a specialized measurement scheme is used to extract the expectation value of the problem Hamiltonian through this mapping. We demonstrate that this method reduces the amount of quantum resources needed to run a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm without making any approximations to the physics of the quantum chemistry problem.</description><author>Kaur Kristjuhan and Mark Nicholas Jones</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01122</guid></item><item><title>Oblivious Transfer from Zero-Knowledge Proofs, or How to Achieve Round-Optimal Quantum Oblivious Transfer and Zero-Knowledge Proofs on Quantum States</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01476</link><description>We provide a generic construction to turn any classical Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocol into a composable (quantum) oblivious transfer (OT) protocol, mostly lifting the round-complexity properties and security guarantees (plain-model/statistical security/unstructured functions...) of the ZK protocol to the resulting OT protocol. Such a construction is unlikely to exist classically as Cryptomania is believed to be different from Minicrypt.   In particular, by instantiating our construction using Non-Interactive ZK (NIZK), we provide the first round-optimal (2-message) quantum OT protocol secure in the random oracle model, and round-optimal extensions to string and k-out-of-n OT.   At the heart of our construction lies a new method that allows us to prove properties on a received quantum state without revealing (too much) information on it, even in a non-interactive way and/or with statistical guarantees when using an appropriate classical ZK protocol. We can notably prove that a state has been partially measured (with arbitrary constraints on the set of measured qubits), without revealing any additional information on this set. This notion can be seen as an analog of ZK to quantum states, and we expect it to be of independent interest as it extends complexity theory to quantum languages, as illustrated by the two new complexity classes we introduce, ZKstateQIP and ZKstateQMA.</description><author>Léo Colisson, Garazi Muguruza and Florian Speelman</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01476</guid></item></channel></rss>
