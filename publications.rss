In conventional lattice surgery compilation schemes, logical circuits are compiled following a place-and-route paradigm, where logical qubits remain statically fixed in space throughout the computation. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by exploiting movable logical qubits via teleportation during the logical lattice surgery CNOT gate. Focusing on lattice surgery with the color code, we propose a proof-of-concept compilation scheme that leverages this capability. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach can substantially reduce the routed circuit depth compared to standard place-and-route compilation techniques. Our results demonstrate that optimizations based on movable logical qubits are not limited to architectures with physically movable qubits, such as neutral atoms or trapped ions - they are also readily applicable to superconducting quantum hardware. An open-source implementation of our method is available on GitHub https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qecc.</description><author>Laura Herzog, Lucas Berent, Aleksander Kubica and Robert Wille</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04169</guid></item><item><title>High schoolers excel at Oxford quantum course using pictorial mathematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00141</link><description>We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding.   This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology.   We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade.   These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.</description><author>Bob Coecke, Aleks Kissinger, Stefano Gogioso, Selma Dündar-Coecke, Caterina Puca, Lia Yeh, Muhammad Hamza Waseem, Emmanuel Pothos, Sieglinde Pfaendler, Vincent Wang-Mascianica, Thomas Cervoni, Ferdi Tomassini, Vincent Anandraj, Peter Sigrist and Ilyas Khan</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00141</guid></item><item><title>Untangling Surface Codes: Bridging Braids and Lattice Surgery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22290</link><description>We present a systematic method for translating fault-tolerant quantum circuits between their braiding and lattice surgery (LS) representations within the surface code. Our approach employs the ZX calculus to establish an equivalence between these two paradigms, enabling verified, bidirectional conversion of arbitrary surface-code-level circuits. We show that both braiding and LS operations can be uniformly expressed as compositions of multibody measurements and demonstrate that the Raussendorf compression rule encompasses all known braid and bridge optimizations. We also introduce a novel CNOT circuit with LS. Our framework provides a foundation for the automated verification, compilation, and benchmarking of large-scale surface code computations, advancing toward a unified formal language for topological quantum computation.</description><author>Alexandru Paler</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22290</guid></item><item><title>Making sense of quantum teleportation: An intervention study on students' conceptions using a diagrammatic approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21443</link><description>Quantum physics education at the upper-secondary level traditionally follows a historical approach, rarely extending beyond early 20th-century ideas, leaving students unprepared for comprehending modern quantum technologies central to everyday life and many facets of modern industry. To address this gap, we investigated how upper-secondary students and pre-service teachers understand quantum teleportation when taught with a simplified diagrammatic formalism based on the ZX-calculus, which represents quantum processes as diagrams of wires and boxes. Through phenomenographic analysis of video-recorded group work sessions, written responses to exercises, and a group interview, with a total of n=21 participants, we identified an outcome space consisting of four qualitatively different, hierarchically ordered categories of description encapsulating the different ways of experiencing quantum teleportation. The categories revealed that a conceptual progression depends on how one understands the temporality in quantum processes, the role of entanglement in quantum teleportation, the active nature of quantum measurements, and interpretations of mathematical operations in the diagrams. Our findings demonstrate that while a simplified diagrammatic formalism for teaching quantum physics provides an accessible entry point at the upper-secondary level, it does not automatically resolve fundamental conceptual challenges, and requires careful consideration in terms of developing teaching and learning sequences. Finally, these results provide educators with a deeper understanding of conceptual affordances and challenges for designing and improving instruction, whilst also highlighting the need for further exploring how students and teachers alike understand quantum phenomena.</description><author>Sebastian Kilde-Westberg, Andreas Johansson, Anna Pearson and Jonas Enger</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21443</guid></item><item><title>Graph Rewriting Language as a Platform for Quantum Diagrammatic Calculi</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15581</link><description>Systematic discovery of optimization paths in quantum circuit simplification remains a challenge. Today, ZX-calculus, a computing model for quantum circuit transformation, is attracting attention for its highly abstract graph-based approach. Whereas existing tools such as PyZX and Quantomatic offer domain-specific support for quantum circuit optimization, visualization and theorem-proving, we present a complementary approach using LMNtal, a general-purpose hierarchical graph rewriting language, to establish a diagrammatic transformation and verification platform with model checking. Our methodology shows three advantages: (1) manipulation of ZX-diagrams through native graph transformation rules, enabling direct implementation of basic rules; (2) quantified pattern matching via QLMNtal extensions, greatly simplifying rule specification; and (3) interactive visualization and validation of optimization paths through state space exploration. Through case studies, we demonstrate how our framework helps understand optimization paths and design new algorithms and strategies. This suggests that the declarative language LMNtal and its toolchain could serve as a new platform to investigate quantum circuit transformation from a different perspective.</description><author>Kayo Tei, Haruto Mishina, Naoki Yamamoto and Kazunori Ueda</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15581</guid></item><item><title>ZX-DB: A Graph Database for Quantum Circuit Simplification and Rewriting via the ZX-Calculus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13033</link><description>Quantum computing is an emerging computational paradigm with the potential to outperform classical computers in solving a variety of problems. To achieve this, quantum programs are typically represented as quantum circuits, which must be optimized and adapted for target hardware through quantum circuit compilation. We introduce ZX-DB, a data-driven system that performs quantum circuit simplification and rewriting inside a graph database using ZX-calculus, a complete graphical formalism for quantum mechanics. ZX-DB encodes ZX-calculus rewrite rules as standard openCypher queries and executes them on an example graph database engine, Memgraph, enabling efficient, database-native transformations of large-scale quantum circuits. ZX-DB integrates correctness validation via tensor and graph equivalence checks and is evaluated against the state-of-the-art PyZX framework. Experimental results show that ZX-DB achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup for independent rewrites, while exposing pattern-matching bottlenecks in current graph database engines. By uniting quantum compilation and graph data management, ZX-DB opens a new systems direction toward scalable, database-supported quantum computing pipelines.</description><author>Valter Uotila, Cong Yu and Bo Zhao</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13033</guid></item><item><title>Ultra Low Overhead Syndrome Extraction for the Steane code</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13700</link><description>We establish a new performance benchmark for the fault-tolerant syndrome extraction of [[7, 1, 3]] Steane code with a dynamic protocol. Our method is built on two highly optimized circuits derived using fault-equivalent ZX-rewrites: a primary fault-tolerant circuit with 14 CNOTs and an efficient non-fault-tolerant recovery circuit with 11 CNOTs. The protocol uses an adaptive response to internal faults, discarding flagged measurements and falling back to the recovery circuit to correct potentially detrimental errors. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the efficiency of our protocol, reducing the logical error rate per cycle by an average of ~14.3% relative to the optimized Steane method [arXiv:2506.17181] and ~17.7% compared to the Reichardt's three-qubit method [arXiv:1804.06995], the leading prior techniques.</description><author>Boldizsár Poór, Benjamin Rodatz and Aleks Kissinger</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13700</guid></item><item><title>Simulating Clifford Circuits with Gaussian Elimination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06127</link><description>Quantum circuits are considered more powerful than classical circuits and require exponential resources to simulate classically. Clifford circuits are a special class of quantum circuits that can be simulated in polynomial time but still show important quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we present an algorithm that simulates Clifford circuits by performing Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit structure. Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm is also efficient when computing many amplitudes or samples of a Clifford circuit. Further, our amplitudes formula provides a new characterization of locally Clifford equivalent graph states as well as an efficient protocol to learn graph states with low-rank adjacency matrices.</description><author>Yuchen Pang and Edgar Solomonik</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06127</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Penrose tensor diagrams with the ZX calculus: Applications to quantum computing, quantum machine learning, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06012</link><description>We introduce the Spin-ZX calculus as an elevation of Penrose's diagrams and associated binor calculus to the level of a formal diagrammatic language. The power of doing so is illustrated by the variety of scientific areas we apply it to: permutational quantum computing, quantum machine learning, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity. Respectively, we analyse permutational computing transition amplitudes, evaluate barren plateaus for SU(2) symmetric ansätze, study properties of AKLT states, and derive the minimum quantised volume in loop quantum gravity.   Our starting point is the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, a purely diagrammatic language that has been proven to be complete for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. That is, any equation that can be derived in the Hilbert space formalism, can also be derived in the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus. We embed the Spin-ZX calculus inside the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, rendering it a quantum information flavoured diagrammatic language for the quantum theory of angular momentum, i.e. SU(2) representation theory. We diagrammatically derive the fundamental spin coupling objects - such as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, symmetrising mappings between qubits and spin spaces, and spin Hamiltonians - under this embedding.   Our results establish the Spin-ZX calculus as a powerful tool for representing and computing with SU(2) systems graphically, offering new insights into foundational relationships and paving the way for new diagrammatic algorithms for theoretical physics.</description><author>Quanlong Wang, Richard East, Razin Shaikh, Lia Yeh, Boldizsár Poór and Bob Coecke</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06012</guid></item><item><title>Optimization of fault-tolerant quantum computing by the ZX-calculus</title><link>https://inspirehep.net/files/1b9b518d03054c5810e04caaa89b6626</link><description>This thesis tackles some of these compilation challenges in the context of large-scale quantum computing. We present efficient algorithms, automated procedures, and formal methods for optimizing fault-tolerant quantum computing. To achieve this, we utilize a wide range of models for representing quantum computation, spanning from abstract formalisms to low-level representations. These models include high-level representations of some quantum operators, the quantum circuit model, and the ZX-calculus, a rigorous graphical language developed for reasoning about quantum processes. Using these diverse representations allows us to design optimization strategies that target different levels of abstraction in the quantum compilation pipeline, thereby contributing to the development of a comprehensive and performant compilation toolchain for fault-tolerant quantum computing.
The results of this thesis are presented in the order in which they would intervene in this compilation toolchain, following the natural flow from high-level quantum operations to hardwareexecutable instructions. The first step considered is quantum circuit synthesis. A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation that represents quantum operations as a sequence of elementary operations called quantum gates and measurements. These quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum computation, analogous to classical logic gates but operating on quantum bits (qubits). While some classical gates, like AND and OR, perform irreversible operations on classical bits, quantum gates are unitary operations that reversibly transform quantum states. They can create and manipulate quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, which have no classical counterparts. The process of quantum circuit synthesis consists in translating abstract quantum operations, often expressed in mathematical form, into sequences of elementary quantum gates. The synthesis phase establishes the baseline implementation that will serve as input to subsequent optimization procedures.</description><author>Vivien Vandaele</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://inspirehep.net/files/1b9b518d03054c5810e04caaa89b6626</guid></item></channel></rss>
